    <h3>Description</h4>
        <p>These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast or as a side dish. If you prefer
            crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Medium russet potatoes, cubed</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse potato cubes with cold water and drain well.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place potatoes in the skillet and season with salt
                and pepper; mix well. Cover and cook 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the lid and cook, turning frequently, until brown and crisp on all sides, about 10 more minutes.
