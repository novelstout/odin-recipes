# odin-recipes

This project is part of the Odin Project cirriculum. Essentially, it is just a bare bones website done up in HTML to practice knowledge of HTML boilerplate, titles, paragraphs, lists, and links/images. 

Using the knowledge above, I was able to create a simple webpage that showed three different recipes. I went a little beyond the assignment and add links back to the index.html file on each page so a user did not have to re-enter the index url to access the other pages. 

I also applied simple styling to the images, namely adjusting the length as each image I found was...too big. I didn't bother trying to adjust the width so that way they would scale porportionately and not stretch.

Line breaks were also used on the index page to help with styling.
